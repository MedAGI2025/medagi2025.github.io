The pharmaceutical sector, characterized by its reliance on extensive knowledge, stands to gain substantial benefits from LLMs. This presentation will delve into how LLMs can enhance productivity in drug discovery by enabling comprehensive analysis of scientific papers and patents, facilitating the generation of novel scientific hypotheses, design of novel drugs, accurate prediction of the pharmacological properties of the designed drugs, and streamlining the drafting of regulatory approval documents. Building upon the speaker&#39;s expertise in AI-driven precision medicine and drug discovery, and recent advancements in biomedically specialized LLMs, this talk will provide insights into the current state and future directions of LLMs in drug discovery. <br data-v-27638776><b data-v-27638776>Bio.</b> Dr. Jaewoo Kang is a Professor of Computer Science at Korea University (since 2006) and CEO of AIGEN Sciences (founded in 2021), where he leads AI-driven precision medicine and drug discovery efforts.
